## Learnign outcomes

At the end of today’s workshop you should be able to do the following:

1. Demonstrate knowledge of how to interact with R using RStudio

2. Identify and employ the basic tools of R Markdown to understand R Notebooks

## Basics

The goal of this lab is to introduce you to R and RStudio. Let us clarify which is which:

1. R is the name of the programming language itself, and

2. RStudio is a convenient interface allowing you to use R easily.

I *strongly* encourage you to explore beyond what the workshops cover. A willingness to experiment will make you a much better programmer. Before we get to that stage, however, you need to build some basic fluency in R. Today we begin with the fundamental building blocks of R and RStudio: the interface, R markdown, and basic commands.

![alt text here](https://github.com/thomcurran/PB130/blob/master/Images/R%20Interface.png?raw=true)

The panel in the upper right contains your workspace as well as a history of the commands that you’ve previously entered. Any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner.

The panel on the left is where the magic happens.
It’s called the console. Every time you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you’re running.
Below that information is the prompt.

As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

To get you started, try the following commands at the R prompt (i.e. right after > on the console).

1. 556 + 232
2. 72/4
3. sqrt(144)
4. log(10)

You can either type the command in manually or copy and paste it from this document. So, as you can see, R is a good calculator. Later, we shall also see that R can be used to graph functions and create a variety of interesting graphics.
